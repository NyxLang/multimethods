/**
 * A euler diagram is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each set holds a predicate. The sets are arranged according
 * to the relationships between their respecive predicates. More specifically, given any two sets A and B within the
 * same euler diagram, set B is a descendent of set A if and only if the set of strings matched by set B's predicate is
 * a proper subset of the set of strings matched by set A's predicate.
 *
 *  and where the sets are arranged
 * according to the set relationships between the predicate's sets of matching strings.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *  The predicates in a
 * euler diagram are arranged according to the relationships between the sets of strings they match.
 *
 * Recall that a predicate matches a particular set of strings. Accordingly, two predicates may have
 * a subset, superset, disjoint, or other relationship, according to the respective sets of string they match.
 *
 * Each set in a euler diagram holds a single predicate, as well as links to all parent and child sets.
 * Every euler diagram has a single root set that holds the universal predicate '**' that matches all strings.
 *
 * In any given euler diagram,
 * for any two sets holding predicates P and Q, if Q is a proper subset of P, then Q will be a
 * descendent of P in the euler diagram. Overlapping predicates (i.e., predicates whose intersection is
 * non-empty but neither is a subset of the other) are siblings in the euler diagram. For overlapping
 * patterns, an additional pattern representing their intersection is synthesized and added to the
 * euler diagram as a descendent of both patterns. All patterns in a euler diagram are normalized. Some sets
 * (such as intersection sets) may be reached via more than one path from the root, but no two
 * sets in a euler diagram hold the same pattern. A euler diagram may thus contain 'diamonds', making it a
 * DAG rather than a tree.
 *
 * NB: The patterns in a euler diagram may not correspond identically to its input patterns, due to (i)
 * pattern normalization, (ii) the addition of the '**' pattern if it was not among the input
 * patterns, and (iii) the addition of intersection patterns for each pair of overlapping input
 * patterns.
 *
 * For example, the input patterns ['foo', 'bar', 'f{chars}', '*o'] result in this 6-set euler diagram:
 *
 *        f*
 *      /    \
 *     /      \
 *    /        \
 * ** --- *o --- f*o --- foo
 *    \
 *     \
 *      \
 *        bar
